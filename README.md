# visualizations
I started this repository after I was assigned to create an...unconventional plotting method for an upcoming research project (a stacked bar plot). While I don't believe the plots will make it through review due to their potentially confusing nature, it was a productive exercise, and I want to give anyone who wants to use said code to make their own confusing plots the option to. I plan to add any more visualization scripts I write to this repo. Cheers!
