Stacked_Bar.py defines a function to plot stacked bars with a novel meaning: here, the absolute height of each bar represents its value on the numerical axis, and each subsequent bar's height is independent of those that appear before it. (Note that the relative difference in length of each color may be misleading, and must be explicated in the caption.) This allows us to plot logarithmic 1-dimensional categorical data in the form of a bar plot. 
The resulting plot is indeed functionally near-identical to a swarm or strip plot, with the potential aesthetic advantage that it fills more space on the canvas and the functional difference that it may be more confusing to the reader as follows an unconventional protocol for stacking bars (which tend to be stacked according to relative heights in linear scale, or via percentage independent of scale).
